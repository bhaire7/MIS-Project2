    "content": "Proper plant care is both an art and a science. Understanding the fundamentals will help you keep your green friends happy and healthy.\n\n## Lighting Requirements\n\n**Bright, Indirect Light:** Most houseplants prefer this. Place near a window but not in direct sun.\n\n**Low Light:** Perfect for offices and darker corners. Snake plants and ZZ plants thrive here.\n\n**Bright, Direct Light:** Succulents and cacti love this. South-facing windows are ideal.\n\n## Watering Wisdom\n\nThe most common mistake is overwatering. Here's how to get it right:\n\n- **Check the soil:** Stick your finger 1-2 inches into the soil. If it's dry, it's time to water.\n- **Water thoroughly:** When you do water, make sure water drains from the bottom holes.\n- **Use room temperature water:** Cold water can shock the roots.\n- **Consider the season:** Plants need less water in winter when growth slows.\n\n## Fertilizing Fundamentals\n\n- **Growing season:** Feed most plants monthly during spring and summer.\n- **Winter rest:** Reduce or stop fertilizing in fall and winter.\n- **Dilute is better:** Use half the recommended strength to avoid burning roots.\n- **Organic options:** Compost tea and worm castings are gentle, effective choices.\n\n## Common Problems and Solutions\n\n**Yellow leaves:** Usually overwatering or natural aging of older leaves.\n\n**Brown leaf tips:** Often caused by low humidity or fluoride in tap water.\n\n**Drooping:** Could be under-watering, overwatering, or shock from environmental changes.\n\n**Pests:** Inspect regularly for spider mites, aphids, and mealybugs. Treat early with insecticidal soap.\n\n## Seasonal Care Tips\n\n**Spring:** Repot if needed, increase watering and fertilizing as growth resumes.\n\n**Summer:** Watch for increased watering needs, provide extra humidity.\n\n**Fall:** Reduce watering and fertilizing, bring outdoor plants inside.\n\n**Winter:** Many plants go dormant - reduce care and avoid repotting.\n\nRemember, every plant is different, and learning their individual needs takes time. Observe your plants regularly and adjust your care routine accordingly."
